While the boss’ top priority is likely to have hardworking employees who fulfill his vision for the company, it’s a safe bet that he’d also like to have more than superficial relationships with the people he works with every day. After all, he probably spends more time with his staff than he does with anyone else. There have been a number of times that I’ve shared ideas with employees, and they’ve come back and suggested—politely of course—that my idea may not be the best route. The reason I don’t get upset is because, along with the rejection of my idea, they present a suggestion for something else. Or, better still, they consider how they can adapt my idea and make it work more effectively.","When I first started my business, it was easy to meet with each employee almost daily, because I only had five employees. Now, with 19, it is more difficult to check in with every employee every day and keep tabs on all the tasks that each person is working on. So it’s important that my employees take the initiative to set up individual meetings with me throughout the month. This helps me know what’s going on in the business—and shows me that they care about their jobs and are keeping my goals and expectations in mind. I would always rather have employees tell me when something at work or at home is affecting the rest of their lives than to wonder why their productivity has suddenly dipped or why they’ve developed a bad attitude. So, if you’re a parent whose office hours are taking a toll on your family, propose a schedule that allows you to work from home part-time. Or, if you’re a part-time college student who needs some extra time off during finals week, see if there is a way to make up the time elsewhere in your schedule.

Some advice from my leader
A team leader should be a role model to his team members. He should treat each and every individual as one and avoid partiality at work Do not give anyone a special treatment just because he drops your son to school every day or says a yes to whatever you say. Appreciate if someone has done exceptionally well but do make sure to correct him if he is wrong somewhere. The team leader should not be rude or harsh to anyone. There is a correct way for everything and one should not insult any team member. It is strictly unethical. Sit with him and make him realize his mistakes. He would definitely look up to you in future.

The superior must not act pricy and should always be accessible to his employees. The individuals must have the liberty to walk up to their immediate bosses in case of a doubt and clear things. The hierarchy should not be too complicated as it leads to confusions and disputes among employees.

The manager must ensure that all important communication takes place on an open forum for everyone to get a common picture. Problems arise when communication is done on a one to one basis. Call everyone together so that all the members are clear as to what is expected out of them and what their colleagues are up to. Communication should be transparent for an effective employee relation. Any employee should not feel neglected or left out. If the team leader wants to pass on any information to his team members, he must send a mail keeping all the related members in the loop.

As a team leader it is one’s prime responsibility to encourage healthy competition at work. Competition is mandatory for an individual’s growth but it should not turn friends to foes. Motivate them constantly to perform better than the other but make sure there are no useless gossips in your team. If you find any of your team members criticizing or making fun of anyone, stop him immediately. Do not provoke any individual to fight, instead intervene and try to resolve the conflict as soon as possible.

Make sure all your team members take their lunch together and you are also a part of it. Don’t discuss work that time. Let them enjoy. Encourage everyone to talk to each other and participate in discussions. Do take the initiative to ask about their families or personal lives as well. They would feel attached to you. If you find any two of your team members not getting along well with each other, make sure both of them work together on the same assignment. They would not be left with any choice than to talk to each other and discuss things. Make them sit together on adjacent workstations so that the comfort level increases. 

The team leader should be neutral to his team members and make sure they enjoy a healthy relationship with him as well as their fellow team members for a better output. A team leader should try his level best to bring his team members closer and bind them together.","My manger provide financial support also apart from work because some time it will be very useful no one can do this my leader provide me any kind of help,also my leader shares the experience with me for positive attitude also share personal experience with me so that we have good relationship like friend ,i am very luck to have the great leader ,also have very much proud to this great leader , so i will ask any kind of help to my leader without hesitating for that i am very much proud work on the team have great leader

Also describe some problems with solution with their experience 

Increase positive emotional connections with others. Just like the flu or a cold, emotions are contagious. If a leader is angry or frustrated that emotion spreads to others.  On the other hand, if a leader is positive and optimistic those emotions also spread. Be aware of your emotional state and work to spread the positive emotions.
Display rock solid integrity. Do others trust you to keep your commitments and promise.Are others confident that you will be fair and do the right thing? We like those we trust, we dislike those we distrust.

Considerations
While many companies employ workers without formal agreements, others have employment-at-will contracts with the workers. The company can terminate the employee for almost any reason, as long as the firm does not make its firing decision based on discrimination or whistle-blowing. This arrangement is sometimes a source of conflict between employee and manager, because the employee is afraid of losing his job.

Recessionary times can negatively affect the relationship between employee and employer. An employee may start to distrust the company more and fear losing his job because of hard financial times. Downturns in the economy actually might be an opportunity for managers to build employee loyalty to the company. Authors Stephen A. Miles and Nathan Bennett, in a ""Bloomberg Business Week"" article, state that ""employers find themselves more frequently asking employees to trust the company—assuring employees that better days are ahead and their efforts today will not be forgotten tomorrow.""

If an employer disregards the concerns of employees, that could lead to a number of important and sometimes expensive problems. Besides turnover, workplace violence is also a risk to the business if employees become disgruntled. Employees who feel slighted by managers may also compromise the security of the company's proprietary information by either sharing trade secrets or taking that valuable knowledge to another competing business. A company that doesn't foster a productive relationship between employees and managers also may develop a poor reputation in the industry.

Employers can take steps toward improving the employee and manager relationship to facilitate a highly productive and happy workplace. For one, managers can implement employee recognition or reward programs to thank workers for a job well done. Meetings and regular communications between employees and managers are also important, especially if workers feel disconnected from the management of the company.

Many times confusions among the team members arise when communication is done on a one to one basis between the manager and subordinates. If a manager wants to build an effective employee relationship, he/she should try to communicate in a transparent manner regarding what is expected out of them and what their colleagues are up to. It’s very crucial to hold open communication forum at least a month having all the team members on board.

Even more importantly, the manager should give feedbacks to the subordinates. It can be positive feedback; even it can be a negative feedback. But, without communicating the mistakes of the subordinates, the manager should not expect improvement in the work of the subordinate. Open communication about mistake and positive feedbacks will make the life of a manager easier without losing his/her ground ",Strongly agree,Somewhat agree,Strongly agree,Strongly agree,Strongly agree,Strongly agree,Strongly disagree,Strongly disagree,Somewhat agree,India,Male,Male,senior executive,entry level executive,Design,Entry Level,5523055

More often though, I am left by myself with little instruction to try to meet deliverables which Are vague and constantly changing.  I email him with my concerns, but in all my time with the company he has answered those emails perhaps twice.  For example, I asked him to update the database I use for training. He refused, citing security concerns. This is totally bogus, as I work with a copy of that very same database, the only issue is it's recency and not security.

With very limited training it is hard to really know what is expected of you, what the overall goal of the company is and how to proceed in finding you fit within the organization. All these item can be tricky when entering a new work environment and social arena. My leaders behavior shows they respect me every once and a while with kind written words. The leader is not one to express emotions or appreciation well, it is a great effort on mynleaders part so I have learned to extend that curtesy to staff. Ocassionally I will,get verbal compliments of appreciation and I receive them more so than other employees and outside staff. My relationship with my leader compared to others in the work place is far better, I have earned the leaders respect and go out of my way to show the leader I put in that extra effort before I am asked. This allows me to have that extra one on one time with the leader as well as directly point out my completed tasks and extra efforts,  to so they can be recognized and compensated but so these efforts can me remembered later. Overall, my relationship is good with my leader currently. However, I have only been employed there in this capacity a limited amount of time. It is my understanding that overtime the relationship with the leader always comes to an impasse sort of a falling out. It is my great effort to not have that happen and keep the interest so to speak with my leader. It is my thinking that doing the extras can only improve my relationship with my leader and prolong the good relationship. ","My leader provides limited support to accomplish my work objectives. An example of the type of support my leader provides is years of knowledge in the field of business we are in, which is something I do not have so it is nice to be able to bounce ideas of my leader and receive a valid opinion. Other support goes in the way of dishing out tasks and assignments and implementation of new rules and policies to make the business more profitable  and effiecent. for instance, my leader recommended after coming to my leader for advice, to implement a new policy to loan out money rot certain employees if needed with the ability to take small deductions from their paychecks. This is nice to do for employees especially around Christmas time and gives the employees a sense of needeing to please the leader in order for her to continue these type of perks within the company. My leader listens to concerns but sometimes becomes distracted and misinterpretates the meaning of the question and the direction of where the conversation is going. This results in my having to repeat the conversation at another time when my leader is more focused or less focused on other things. There is little coach or mentoring other than the verbal advice of that has been done before and either idea was successful or not. My current leader knowing the ins and outs of the business and being in the business and extensive a,punt of years makes for a wealth of knowledge, however the years bring about other issues such as willingness to try new things or adapt to any changes. One becomes so used to the routine of things even if the routine is no longer productive and unfortunately sometime no longer profitable either.

In my point of view, I don't want to separate him by saying that he is my head.

He always explains us the reason and the goal of our projects and tries to get our suggestion to accomplish that project. We discuss the whole day, everyone out from our team may think that we are wasting our time but at the end, we complete our whole project 2-3 days before the deadline.

When he found I have more talents than my current field, he nurtured me to proceed further. When some people are jealous of me, he gave me more work so that I can prove to myself and to them. He made others realize, I work properly and honestly. He keeps on compliments me even after 6 years of service in same job.

My boss is honest, brilliant and very much innovative. My organization had taught me a lot to improve myself and the management team is very supportive and always encourages new ideas. My company is one of the best platforms to prove ourselves. 

I have observed the lot of strong points in my boss but the most things which I have observed or I have learnt from him is that he is innovative, energetic, is punctuality, well merged with the time management skills and fully dedication to the work and always try to learn from mistake or failure and guide to all employees on time by time and arranging training to the employees when ever needed, giving the chances to the employees for their better improvement in their respective area, but as as we know that every person have some drawback also, nobody is always perfect. 

My boss has good ideas, they work very well. The only issue really is he always has everyone working on what they are weak at. That is good for us but not good for overall productivity. A good team would really have people doing what they are good at. So each team member covers of certain areas for the team and you have a highly effective team, with everyone doing excellent work in areas of proficiency.

He is approachable, spontaneous, energetic, punctual, having ability to prioritize things well, very supportive for his team members, a good motivator, strong in networking and an ambitious person. I have learnt a lot under him and he has always been helpful to me.

My supervisor clearly explained all the issues and fully answered
my questions. After finishing every task, his comments helped me
reflect on and improve my performance. He constantly encouraged
me to address my objectives, such as improving my interviewing
skills and building my technical knowledge.

About the weak points I have never notice. He/her is a good human and truly person and I have thought very carefully that he thought me about goal, achievements, life and about a person and I have learnt a lot from him. I got very little time to judge him but whatever time I have spent with him, did not encountered anything big enough that hampers a team growth and opportunities. He gave enough opportunities to each of us to grow as much as we can by pushing ourselves to highest limits. As not all people are perfect and there are always good and bad sides of a person. Correlating these attributes of my boss, the good thing about him is, he is very motivated person, he encourages his team mates to work collaboratively with maximum output and minimum rework. he don't know or he has no behaviour of appriciating other no matter how much best you do to attend responsibilities, he don't give chance to any one to express views or feelings, he is dynarmic; he is not a person to be trusted on his orders unless the order is in written form, he feels to be special and so more!

There is a certain sense of comraderie ""in the trenches,"" so to speak, in dealing with the chaos all around and all the little fires that have to be put out. She does provide advice, and some short- to mid-range goals for me and is supportive of that, but I usually have to find my own formal training programs or development -- through conferences, webinars through a professional organization, or through online MOOCs such as edX or Coursera. She shows respect mainly by letting me take my own initiative to set forth certain things that I want to achieve -- like projects of my own making that help her, help our department, and help the entire organization at large -- without asking for me to do them.

This happened this past summer around the time of the Orlando Pulse massacre, and also being LGBT, I was extremely on edge. She was highly dismissive at first, and was publicly so. It took me being very very assertive and me writing things down formally in emails, including one to the organization's ombudsperson as well as a few to individuals in my organization trained in trauma response, mass shootings and hate crimes, for her to take things seriously, and her also to realize that as a gay man, I was under severe stress, on edge, and in a sense of hyperawareness at the time. She apologized later, and after work over drinks she really really apologized and said she did not realize how I must have felt. It's sad it took 49 people dying and emails to people in other parts of the organization for her to stop being dismissive, but it's what it is.

When you are doing a great job you won't hear any praise but if you do something wrong she then wants to talk to you.  I don't feel like my efforts are appreciated at all.  I feel that if a worker is helping the company to make money, that employee should be appreciated and made to feel like they matter.  If a worker takes the time out to do all that they can to work, the supervisor should take notice of this.  I don't think that the supervisor that I have really even makes note of good things, only things that don't matter.  For example, if I do well in the sales department she won't say a word that week.  Two weeks later if I fall behind in sales, she will then send an email to me saying ""she needs  to see me.""  If I did well all the time I would literally never hear from her.  It is very sad that it is this way but it really is this way. 

My supervisor does not take the time out to find out what my needs are.  She is only interested in exploiting any problems that I may have in order to make herself to appear smarter or better than the rest of us.  I have never felt close to her or that she would ever try to help me out of any type of bind.  I would never even ask her for a favor because I know that she wouldn't go out of her way to do anything for anyone other than herself.  She is not a people person so I don't know why she is a manager in the first place.

She encourages any employee who feels that they need guidance to see her.  She constantly reminds us that she used to be where we are and understands some of the challenges that we may face.  Most employees do take her up on this offer because sometimes situations occur that we did not anticipate and we do appreciate having someone to go to that can answer questions.  We usually pass the information that we learn along to other co-workers so that if a particular situation arises again, we will know exactly how to handle this.  This method really does come in handy because you find that as the years pass that you have fewer and fewer questions about your job because the question has already been answered previously and documented.  Personally, I use sticky notes and other forms of reminders to have needed information handy and ready to use when I need it.  I really don't like going to the supervisor for help because it makes me look incompetent.  I like when I can find the solution to a problem on my own without asking for help.  I also like when others that are equal to me come to me for assistance.  I feel that this will help my chances for promotion sometime down the road.  In my opinion, the more others come to you and the less that you go to your supervisor for help, the better it is for you.  The supervisor will remember that you are the one who can work independently and give you a promotion before anyone else.  This is why my relationship with my supervisor is so professional.

If you have a simple question about a certain function of your job, she will guide you on that topic.  She can most be reached via instant messenger or via email.  She is the type that answers instantly.  She does not like to keep people waiting which is great for us.   I really like that about her.  She is very responsive.  She makes sure that we have a list of objectives that we understand and can follow on a daily basis.  During evaluations, we go down the list of objectives and discuss our progress and/or weaknesses in any area.  It is very useful to get this type of critique.
